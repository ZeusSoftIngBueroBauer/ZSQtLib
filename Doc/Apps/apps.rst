C++ Applications
================

Using the ZSQtlib framework it was easy to implement a remote command server providing a set of remote commands and a
generic remote command client to control the remote command server using the C++ programming language.

Beside the Remote Command classes also Trace classes are provided by the ZSQtLib which are used by the logging
modules within LTT. Therefore not only the generic remote command client application but also the Method Trace Client
application will be described.
